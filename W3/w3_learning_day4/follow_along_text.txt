Lesson - Python - sort lists 
Sort list Alphanumercally 
Listt objects have a sort() method that will sort the list alphanumerically, ascending, by default:  

Sort Descending 
To sort descending, use the keyword argument reverse = True: 

Customize Sort Function 
you can also customize your own function by using the keyword argument key = function. 
The function will return a number that will be used to sort the list (the lowest number first):

Case Insensitive Sort 
 
by default the sort() method is case sensitive, resulting in all capital letters being sorted before lower case letters: 

Luckily we can use built-in functions as key functions when sorting a list. 
so if you want a case-insensitive sort function, use str.lower as a key function: 

Reverse Order 
What if ou want to reverse the order of a list, regardless of the alphabet? 
The reverse() method reverses the current sorting order of the elements.
