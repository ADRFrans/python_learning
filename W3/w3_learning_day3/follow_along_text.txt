Python operators 
Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. 
In the example beloew, we use the + operator to add together two values. 
print(10 + 5)

Although the + operator is often used t oadd together two values, like in the example above, it can also be used to add together a variable and a avalue, or two variables: 

sum1 = 100 + 50 
sum2 = sum1 + 250 
sum3 = sum2 + sum2

Division in python 
Python has two division operators 
/ division returns a float 
// floor division returns an int 

The Walrus operator 
python 3.8 introduced the := operator, known as the walrus operator. it assigns values to varaibles as part of a larger expression: 

Caomparison operators 

== - equal 
!- - not equal 
> - greater than 
< - less than 
>= - greater than or equal to 
<= - Less than or equal to 

Examples 

Chaining comparison operators 
Python allows you to chain comparison operators: 

Python logical operators 
Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements: 

and Returns True if both statements are true 
or returns true if one of the statements is true 
not Reverse the result, returns false if the result is true 

Identity operators 
Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same 
object, with the same memory location: 

is - returns true if both variables are the same object 
is not - returns true if both variables are not the same object 

Difference between is and == 
is - checks if both variables point to the same object in memory 
== - checks if the values of both variables are equal 

Membership operators 
In - returns True if a sequence with the specfified value is present in the object | exp x in y 
not in - returns true if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object | exp x not in y



member ship operators also work with strings: 

bitwsie operators 

& == AND - Sets each bt to 1 if both bits are 1 example x & y
| == OR - sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1 x | y 
^ == XOR - sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1 example x ^ y
~ == NOT - inverts all the bits example  ~x 
<< == Zero fill left shift - shifts left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off example x << 2 
>> == Signed right by pushin copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off 

Example 
The & operator compares each bit and set it to 1 if both are 1, otherwise it is set to 0: 

print(6 & 3)

The binary representation of 6 is 0110 
The binary representation of 3 is 0011

Then the & operator compares the bits and returns 0010, which is 2 in decimal. 

Example the | operator compares each bit and set it to 1 if one or both is 1, otherwise it is set to 0: 
print(6 | 3)
the binary representation of 6 is 0110 
The binary representation of 3 is 0011

Then the | operator compares the bits and returns 0111, which is 7 in decimal 

Example
the ^ opertor compares each bit and set it to 1 if only one is 1, otherwise (if both are 1 or both are 0) it is set to 0: 

print(6 ^ 3)

The binary representation of 6 is 0110 
The binary representation of 3 is 0011

Then the ^ operator comapres the bits and returns 0101, which is 5 in decimal.  

operator precedence 

Example 
Parentheses has the highest precedence, meaning that expressions inside the parentheses must be evaluated first: 

Operator	Description	
()	Parentheses	
**	Exponentiation	
+x  -x  ~x	Unary plus, unary minus, and bitwise NOT	
*  /  //  %	Multiplication, division, floor division, and modulus	
+  -	Addition and subtraction	
<<  >>	Bitwise left and right shifts	
&	Bitwise AND	
^	Bitwise XOR	
|	Bitwise OR	
==  !=  >  >=  <  <=  is  is not  in  not in 	Comparisons, identity, and membership operators	
not	Logical NOT	
and	AND	
or	OR
