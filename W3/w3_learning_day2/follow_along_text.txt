Python - Modify Strings 
Python has a set of built-in methods that you can use on strings 

Upper Case 

The Upper() method returns the string in upper case: 
a = "Hello, world!"
print(a.upper())

Lower Case 
Example 
The Lower() method returns the sting in lower case: 

Remove Whitespace 
WhiteSpace is the space before and/or after the actual text, and very often you want to remove this space. 

Replace String 
Example 
The replce() method replaces a string with another string 

Split Strig 
The Split() method returns a list where the text between the specified separator becomes the lis items 

Lesson - Python - String Concatenation 

String Concatenation 
To concatenate, or combine, two strings you can use the + operator 

Lesson - Formay Strings 
String Format 
as we learned in the python variables chapter, we cannot combine strings and numbers like this: 
age = 36
txt = "My name is john, I am " + age 
print(txt)

but we can combine strings and numbers using f-strings on the format() method 

F- Strings 
F- string was introduced in Python 3.6 and is now the preferred way of formatting strings. 
To specify a string as an f-string simply put an f in font of the string literal, and add curly brackets as placeholders for varaibles and other operations 

PlaceHolders and Modifiers 
A PLaceHolder can contain variables, operations, functions, and modifiers to format the value 

Example 
price = 59
txt = f"The price is {price} dollars"
print(txt)

A placeholder can include a modifier to format the value 
A modifier is included by adding a : followed by a legfal format type like .2f which means fixed point number with 2 decimals: 

Example
Display the price with 2 decimals:

price = 59
txt = f"The price is {price:.2f} dollars"
print(txt)

A placeholder can contain python code, like math operations: 

Example 

Perform a math operation in the placeholder, and return the result:

txt = f"The price is {20 * 59} dollars"
print(txt)
