Python Statements 

Statements 
A computer Program is a list of instructions to be executed by a computer 
the following statement prints the text python is fun to the screen 

Many Statements 
Most python programs contain many statements 
The Statements are executed one by one, in the same order aas they are written

Example explained 
frpm the example above, we have three statements 

the first stement is executed first 
then the second 
and at last, the third statement is exeecuted 

Semicolons(Optional, rarely used )
Semicolons are optional in python. you can write multiple statements on one line 
by separating them with ; 
but this is rarely used because it makes it hard to read: 

however, if you put two statements on the same line without a separator(newline or ;) Python will give an error: 

Python output / print 
Print Text 
you have already learned that you can use the print() fuction to display text or output values

You can use the print() function as many times as you wany. each call prints text on a new line by default:

Double Quotes 
Text in python must be inside quotes. You can use either " double quotes or ' single quotes: 
Example 
print("This will work!")
print('this will also work')

if you forget to put text inside quotes, python will give an error 

Print without a new line 
By default, the print() function ends with a new line. 
if you want to print multiple words on the same line, you can use the end parameter: 

Print Numbers you can also use the print() function to display numbers: 
However, unline text, we don't put numbers inside double quotes: 

you can also do math inside the print() function: 

Mix Text and Numbers 
you can combine text and numbers in one output by separating them with a comma: 

Python Variables 
Variables 
variables are containers for storing data values. 

Creating Variables 
Python has no command for declaring a variable. 
A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it. 

Example 

varaible do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set. 

Example 
casting if you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting 

Example 

get the type 
you can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.

Single or Double quotes? 
String variavle scan be declared either by using single or double quores 

Case-Sensitive
variable names are case-Sensitive

Lesson - Python - Variable Names 

Variable Names 
A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume).

Rules for python variable: 
    -A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character 
    -A variable name cannot start with a numbe rarely
    -A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores
    -Variable names are case-sensitive 
    -A variable name cannot be any of the Python Keywords. 

Multi words variable Names 
Variable names with more than one word can be difficult to read. 
There are several techniques you can use to make them more readable:

Camel case 
Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter: 
myVariableName = "John"

Pascal Case 
Each word starts with a capital letter: 
MyVariableName = "John"

Snake Case 
Each word is separated by an underscore character: 
my_variable_name = "John"

Lesson - Python Variables  Assign Multiple Values 

Many Values to Multiple variables 
Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line: 

Note: make sure the number of variables matches the number of values, or else you will get an error. 

One value to multiple variables 
and you can assign the same value to multiple variables in one line: 
Example 

unpack a collection if you have a collection in a list, tuple etc. Python allows you to extract the values into variables. 
This is called unpacking.

Lesson - Python - output variables 

output Variables 
The print() function is often used to ouput variables. 

Example 

In the print() function, you output multiple variables, separated by a comma:

Example 

You can also use the + operator to ouput multiple variables: 

Example 

Ntoice the space character after "Python " and "is ". without them the result would be "Pythonisawesome"

For numbers, the + character works as a mathematical operator:

Example 

In the print() function, when you try to combine a string and a number with the + operator, python will give you an error: 

Example 

The best way to output multiple variables in the print() function is to separate them with commas, which even support different data types:

Example 

Lesson - Python - Global Variables 

Global Variables 
Variables that are created outside of a function (as in all of the examples in the previous pages) are known as global variables

global variables can be used by everyone, both inside of functions and outside. 

Example 
Create a variable outside of a function, and use it inside the function 

x = "awesome"

def myfunc():
    print("Python is " + x)

myfunc()

if you create a variable with the same name inside a function, this variable will be local, and can only be used inside the function. The global variables 
with the same name will remain as it was, global and with the original value.

Example 
Create a variable inside a function, with the same name as the global variable

x = "awesome"

def myfunc():
  x = "fantastic"
  print("Python is " + x)

myfunc()

print("Python is " + x)

The Global keyword 
Normally, when you create a variable inside a function, that variable is local, and can only be used inside that function 
to crate a global variable inside a function, you can use the global keyword.

Example 
if you use the global keyword, the variable belongs to the global scope:

def myfunc():
  global x
  x = "fantastic"

myfunc()

print("Python is " + x)

Also, use the global keyword if you want to change a global variable inside a function. 

Example 
To change the value of a global variable inside a function, refer to the variable by using the global keyword: 
x = "awesome"

def myfunc():
  global x
  x = "fantastic"

myfunc()

print("Python is " + x)

Python Data types 
Built in Data Types 
In programming, data type is an important concept.
Variable can store data of differenet types, and different types can do different things. 
Python has the following data types built in by default in these categories: 

Text Type:	str
Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
Mapping Type:	dict
Set Types:	set, frozenset
Boolean Type:	bool
Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview
None Type:	NoneType

Getting the data type 
you can get the data type of any object by using the type() function: 

Example
print the data type of the variable x: 
x = 5
print(type(x))

setting the data type 
In python, the data type is set when you assign a value to a variable:

see https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_datatypes.asp for setting each data type 

Setting the Specific data type 
if you want to specify the data type, you can use the following constructor functions: 

see https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_datatypes.asp for setting Specific data types 

Lesson - Python Numbers 

Python Numbers 
There are three numeric types in Python: 
    -int 
    -float 
    - complex 
Varables of numeric types are created when you assign a value to them: 

Example 
x = 1    # int
y = 2.8  # float
z = 1j   # complex

To verify the type of any object in python, use the type() function: 

Example
print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))

int or integer is a whole number positive or negative without decimals of unlimited length. 

Example
Integers:

x = 1
y = 35656222554887711
z = -3255522

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))

Float 
float or floating point number is a number positive or negative containing one or more deciamls 

Example
Floats:

x = 1.10
y = 1.0
z = -35.59

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))

float can also be scientific numbers with an "e" to indicate the power of 10. 

Example 
Floats: 
x = 35e3
y = 12E4
z = -87.7e100

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))

Complex numbers are written with a 'j' as the imaginary part: 

Example
Complex:

x = 3+5j
y = 5j
z = -5j

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))

type conversion 
you can convert from one type to another with the int(), float() and complex() methods: 

Note: you cannot convert complex numbers into another number type. 

Random number
Pyton does not have a random() function to make a random number, but python has a built in module called random that can be used to make random numbers: 

Example
Import the random module, and display a random number from 1 to 9:

import random

print(random.randrange(1, 10))

Lesson Python Casting 

Specify a Variable Type 
there may be times when you want to specify a type on to a variable. This can be done with casting. Python is an object-orientated languag, and as scuh it 
it uses classes to define data types, including its primitive types. 
casting in python is therefor eedone using constructor functions: 
    - int() - constructs an integer number frm an integer literal, a float literal (by removing all decimals), or a string literal(proving the string represents a whole number)
    - float() - constructs a float number from an integer literal, a float literal or a string literal (providing the string represents a float or an integer)
    - str() - constructs a string from a wide variety of data types, including strings, integer literals and float literals

Example
Integers:
x = int(1)   # x will be 1
y = int(2.8) # y will be 2
z = int("3") # z will be 3

Example 
Floats:

x = float(1)     # x will be 1.0
y = float(2.8)   # y will be 2.8
z = float("3")   # z will be 3.0
w = float("4.2") # w will be 4.2

Example 
Strings: 
x = str("s1") # x will be 's1'
y = str(2)    # y will be '2'
z = str(3.0)  # z will be '3.0'
