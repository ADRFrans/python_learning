# Learning History

This file is maintained by the assistant to track your progress so we can resume quickly.

## Session protocol

- When asked "Where did we leave off" or "next steps", read both history.md and LearningPlan.md first.
- Response format: short description of the last session completed, then next steps.
- I will update history.md and LearningPlan.md during the session (as needed) and at the end of each session without prompting.
- At logical checkpoints, I will prompt you to update your git repo (status/add/commit, and push if desired).
- I will also surface git commands at random moments for practice (status/diff/add/commit/push).
- Next step rule: The first "next step(s)" request in a session follows the current Next step here. Subsequent "next step(s)" requests in the same session advance to the next logical step and update both history.md and LearningPlan.md.

## Session end checklist

- Update history.md and LearningPlan.md.
- Run git status.
- Commit changes with a clear message.
- Push to GitHub.

## Current status

- What you worked on: Built bigram counts table and converted counts to row-wise probabilities.
- What felt easy:
- What felt confusing:
- Next step: Phase 2 Lesson 3: sampling next characters from probabilities.
