- //  floor division (int)

Assignment expression
- :=  walrus operator (assign inside an expression)

Comparison
- ==  equal
- !=  not equal
- >   greater than
- <   less than
- >=  greater than or equal
- <=  less than or equal
- Chaining example: 1 < x < 10

Logical
- and  True if both sides are True
- or   True if either side is True
- not  flips True/False

Identity
- is      True if both variables point to same object
- is not  True if variables point to different objects

Membership
- in      True if item is in a sequence/collection
- not in  True if item is not in a sequence/collection

Conditional expression
- a if condition else b  choose a or b based on condition

Indexing / slicing
- x[i]        index access
- x[-1]       negative index (from end)
- x[a:b]      slice (start inclusive, end exclusive)
- x[:b]       slice from start
- x[a:]       slice to end
- x[a:b:c]    slice with step
