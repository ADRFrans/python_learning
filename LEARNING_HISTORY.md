## Lesson 5 (Lists of dicts + aggregation + randomness)
- Prompt: "for this i want to create a random list generating function, what is the import for math" | Response: Explained imports for random and math.
- Prompt: "checkout lesson 5" | Response: Reviewed; noted skill list vs single skill, total skills counting, random.choice.
- Prompt: "hint on how to add more then one skill" | Response: Suggested random.sample or repeated random.choice.
